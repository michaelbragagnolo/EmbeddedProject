# Generative Replay for Continual Learning
</div>
Repository that is intended to keep track of the work for the project of the course Embedded Systems and that contains all the reference material and the scripts developed to this end.

### PROJECT PROPOSAL
The presented work aims at providing interesting improvements to replay and memory-based approaches that store past data to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, by performing extensive experimental evaluation on the novel framework of **Generative Replay**.
